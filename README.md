An exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project focused on understanding health-related patterns in a stroke dataset. This notebook uses Python and popular data science libraries to extract insights from real-world medical data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves:
- Importing and exploring a dataset related to stroke occurrence
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Generating descriptive statistics
- Visualizing key trends and risk factors
- Highlighting correlations that could support stroke prediction or prevention strategies

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`stroke_data.csv`) includes the following features:
- Demographics: `gender`, `age`, `ever_married`, `work_type`
- Health metrics: `hypertension`, `heart_disease`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`
- Lifestyle: `smoking_status`, `Residence_type`
- Target variable: `stroke`
